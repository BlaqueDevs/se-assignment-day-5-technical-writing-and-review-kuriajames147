## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types
ANSWERS
For tech experts:
a) go direct to the specifics
b) use illustrations when needed
c) give examples that reflect real-world technical applications

For non-experts
a) Break down technical jargons into layman's language
b) use analogies that relate to common experiences
c) focus on using step by step instructions with visuals

## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
